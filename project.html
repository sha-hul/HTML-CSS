                    A living room is a room in a home. The living room in a home is shared by the people living in the home. In the living room they talk with each other and their guests and do other things such as reading or watching television. The furniture can include a couch, chairs, tables, lamps, a television, curtains and pictures. People may have started using the compound word, living room, in the early twentieth century.

                    <h1>Bedroom</h1>
                    My house is quite large. It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, two living rooms, a dining room, a special games room and a big front and back garden.

My favourite rooms is my bedroom. I love it because it is the only room in my house where I can lock myself away from the rest of the world. After a long day, all i want to do is go up tom my cosy bedroom and either listen to some mellow music, or lie down, unwind and watch a bit of T.V or maybe even a relaxing film.

        <div class="tank1 tank"><h1 style="text-align: left;">Sofa</h1>The most common types of couches include the two-seater, sometimes referred to as a loveseat, and the sofa. The loveseat is designed for seating two people, while the sofa has more than two cushion seats. A sectional sofa, often just referred to as a "sectional", is formed from multiple sections (typically two, three, and four) and usually includes at least two pieces which join at an angle of 90 degrees or slightly greater. Sectional sofas are used to wrap around walls or other furniture.</div>
